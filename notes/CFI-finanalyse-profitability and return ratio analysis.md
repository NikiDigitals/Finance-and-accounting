Ratios:
Performance ratios: How is the company doing?

Financial Leverage Ratios: Solvency Ratios, and Liquidity Ratios. 
- Solvency ratio focuses on the long-term financial health and its ability to handle long-term obligations. 
- Liquidity ratio is focused on the short-term financial health, covering financial needs and obligations. 

Return ratios: Essential for evaluating investment returns.
- Return on Assets (ROA) net income / Total Assets
- Return on Equity (ROE) Net income / Total shareholders' Equity
  ROE focuses on returns generated for equity investors.
- Return on invested Capital (ROIC) Net operating Profit after tax (NOPAT = EBIT*(1- Tax Rate)) / (Net debt + Equity)
  ROIC calculates a profit figure that excludes interest expenses, representing the return to debtholders. 

Financial statements:
- An income statement (statement of Profit and loss) Shows Revenue, expenses and the profit and loss for a given period. 
- The balance sheet (statements of financial position) shows Assets (owns), Liabilities (owes) and equity (worth) at a particular point in time.
- Statement of cash flows shows how the business generated/ used cash for operating, investing, or financing activities.
